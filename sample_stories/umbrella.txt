The rain had started without warning—one of those sudden spring showers that turned sidewalks into rivers and made everyone scramble for cover. Mia groaned as she stood under the narrow awning of a bakery, watching the downpour with a look of betrayal.

"Forgot your umbrella too?" a voice asked beside her.

She turned to see a guy, maybe a little older than her, holding a dripping messenger bag and smiling sheepishly.

"Yeah," she sighed. "Weather app said '10% chance.' I took that personally."

He laughed. "Same. I even wore suede shoes today. Rookie mistake."

She smiled despite herself. There was a kind of shared misery that made strangers feel like teammates.

"I'm Ethan," he said, holding out a hand.

"Mia."

They shook hands awkwardly, both trying not to let their wet sleeves touch.

"Well, Mia, do you want to make a run for it or wait it out?"

"I was gonna wait, but the storm seems like it’s getting worse, not better."

He looked down the street, then back at her. "Alright, I’ve got an idea. I’ve got a tiny umbrella in my bag. It’s not much, but if we huddle like penguins, it might work."

"Penguin huddling, huh?" she said, amused. "I’m in."

He pulled out the smallest umbrella she’d ever seen. They both laughed as he popped it open—barely enough to cover one person, let alone two.

"Ready?" he asked.

"Let’s do it."

They stepped out into the rain, shoulders touching, laughing the whole way as the umbrella failed spectacularly. By the time they reached the subway station, they were soaked and out of breath.

Mia turned to him, hair plastered to her forehead. "Well, that was terrible."

"Terribly fun," he said, grinning.

She nodded, surprised at how much she agreed. As the train pulled in, she hesitated.

"Hey," he said before she could step inside, "maybe next time we check the weather together?"

She smiled. "Deal."
